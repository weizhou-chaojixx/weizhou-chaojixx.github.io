I am an Associate Professor of the School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. 

Myresearch interests cover a wide range of systems security, including trusted computing and IoT systems security. I am especially interested in developing automatic tools to detect and exploit previously unknown vulnerabilities in IoT firmware and platforms. My work helped many high-profile vendors improve their products' security, including Alibaba, JD, Apple, Samsung etc.
